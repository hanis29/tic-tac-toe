# tic-tac-toe

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, 'X' and 'O.' Players take turns inputting their positions on the 3x3 game board using numbers 1 to 9.

The game includes the following functionalities:

a) Marking the Game Board: Players can input their positions, and the game board updates accordingly. Input validation ensures that positions are within the valid range and not already occupied.

b) Displaying the Game Board: The current state of the game board is displayed after each move, showing 'X' and 'O' marks.

c) Checking for a Win: The program checks for winning combinations, such as three 'X' or three 'O' in a row, column, or diagonal.

d) Checking for a Tie: It determines if the game ends in a tie when the board is fully occupied.

e) Restarting the Game: After a game ends, players have the option to restart and play again.
